# APLICACIÓN WEB: MY SERIES FILE ♡!

## This is my second try with JavaScript, and i want to make your leisure time easier!

I create a cute, pink and helpful web to find and to add your favorite series of all times!
I use an API to bring me json.files, and start painting. With a fetch function request,
i get the information that i want to show in my page, travelling in the differents arrays
and objects with bucles functions. So, with that, i could create my html painting from
javascript! The basic structure is in my html, but my interactive structure is in the
magic javascript...
Input field, has a listener event, and when you write and click, handlerpetition function to
API works, the show starts. Painting functions create a render visualization, they traduce
json files, picking some info to fetch function, and giving it to my pink page. In that
moment, you can search and search, and last find.
If you are lazy (like me) i add a favorite section, and there, you can save your favorite
series! When you clik over some serie current.target, favorite class functions starts to work,
and pop up in favorite list...add as many as you want! And don't worry, they keep on localstorage :)
But, if one day your Friend's loop is enough, you can put off on your list, you just have to
click on. Or if you want to start a new serieslife, push on click!
I am working on clean button, so wait, please.
